# SoyBeanML
The dataset I am working with gives all kinds of geographical and genetic
data about different varieties of soy beans. I am using various machine
learning models to best predict which growing conditions and plant types
produce optimal yields. 
### Progress
Different attempts at predicting yield are in different branches. So far the
completed branches are as follows:
1. **univariate-linear-regression** - Using scikit learn  to predict
   yield based only on temperature.
2. **multivariate-linear-regression** - Using scikit learn to predict yield
   based on all given geographical data. This includes features like top-soil,
   soil ph level, irrigation, precipitation, and many others.
